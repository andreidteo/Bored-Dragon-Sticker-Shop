       <h1> The Bored Dragon </h1>
       <p>Once upon a time, there was a cold hearted, backstabbing dragon that was
so mean and ugly. He loved to travel to the human world and snatch little
kids out of their beds while they were sleeping, and he would drop them
down his green tortoise throat. Now back in those days all the kids would
sit in his stomach and cry, "Let us out, Let us out." Of course he would not
let them out, but sometimes a brave little soul would travel the long journey
till he plopped out the other end.
Now there was a little girl named Susie who had heard about this evil
dragon, and wanted to see for herself that he was real. So one night she
crawled under her sister's bed waiting for the dragon to pick her up. The
dragon came slowly and silently through the city, getting ready to pick up
his midnight snack. When Susie saw her she was amazed at how ugly he
was, his mouth was dripping with drool ready to pick a kid. He then picked
up Susie's sister with Susie hanging on to her back. Right before she was
going to be dropped in the pot of doom, she jumped swiftly on to the
dragons head and tickled the beast until he left the kids free.</p>
